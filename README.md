### What is NIX?
---

NIX is an open source digital currency that focuses on privacy centered metrics. NIX's goal is to create a global private DEX trading platform for asset trades. With NIX, you will be able to privatize any cryptocurrency through use of the NIX DEX platform. Giving all currencies the power of privacy.

### Key Features
---

* NIX utilizes a custom built privacy library that integrates Zerocoin/Bulletproofs and TOR support. This allows transaction privacy in its fullest and most trustless form.

* NIX aims to create a privatized DEX platform built on top of Blocknet’s DEX api to conduct privatized atomic swaps through use of NIX’s privacy library.

* Custom lightning network channels for instantaneous NIX to NIX transactions.
