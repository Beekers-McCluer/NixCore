### What is NIX?
---

NIX is an open source digital currency that focuses on privacy centered metrics. NIX's goal is to create a global private cross chain transaction platform. With NIX's initial use case, you will be able to privatize any cryptocurrency through use of the NIX DEX platform. Giving all currencies the power of privacy.

### Key Features
---

* NIX utilizes a custom built privacy library that integrates Zerocoin/Bulletproofs and TOR support. This allows transaction privacy in its fullest and most trustless form.

* NIX aims to create a privatized DEX platform built on top of already developed DEX volumes to conduct privatized atomic swaps through use of NIXâ€™s privacy library.

* Ghost Protocol to enhance privacy features.
